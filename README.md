# Weather_Dashboard

## Description

As we have experienced the codification of a calendar, working for ourselves on a full layout experience resolving the API issues and layout formats to complete this week's assignment was no less challenging than any other previous project. Working in such a complex concept will provide new ideas moving forward as to what we, as developers, can use as tools so that in the future we could create applications that will affect in a positive manner.

Third-party and Server-side API's create an extension of the language we already have brought forward in a more concise and derivative way of achieving our goals. By combining all 3 platforms (HTML, CSS and, Javascript) we become more accustomed to the symbols utilized reiterating exercises that create understanding in the long run for us student to become teachers at one point.

This week's assignment provided the tools to use different frameworks to achieve the goal of creating a weather application forecast. Weather is a variable in our human experience that affects our day to day lives so, what has been achieved, as I mentioned in the introduction. will give us an idea of what kind of tools we have at our disposal moving forward to create experiencial human applications that could affect positively in diferent environments.
